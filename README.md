Step 5) I use brave so I would select 'Load Unpacked' than select said folder you just extracted (basically installs an extention from the specified folder you extracted)

Step 4) If all went well, you should see the extention installed. If not, please feel free to post an issue [HERE](https://github.com/Twigzie/Fantality-Infinite-Kiwi/issues)

If you have the website already open, you will need to retrigger the tab (activate any other tab and go back to LostMerchants)
